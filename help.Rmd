## Anonymous feedback
I want to make this class a welcome learning opportunity for everyone. I welcome your comments and constructive critique. What I do not welcome is flaming, trolling or insults. Here are some examples of appropriate uses of this feedback form. 

1) Class activities. What should I start doing, stop doing, and keep doing? Is the pace too fast? To slow?
2) Topics: Is there something specific you would like brought up in class, but don't want to be the one to bring it up?
3) Flagging the Misfires. I am bound to make mistakes and microaggressions regarding culture, religion, gender, and diversity. Helping you feel safe is a real-time pursuit. If my remarks created discomfort, you can use this form to voice the concern quickly rather than saving it for the course evaluation months later.
4) Words of Encouragement. I need positive feedback to keep me recharged!

## Slack

Slack is a channel-based messaging platform very similar to Discord. Slack > Discord primarily because of threaded conversations. This is a crucial piece for classroom discussion. Yes I know Discord > Slack for many other reasons that I won't get into here. If/When Discord implements threads, I will likely convert. 

* **How to Join our Slack workspace.** An invite will be sent to your campus email. 
* **Use the Desktop app*** You must download and install Desktop app. 
    - The web version requires on you remembering to login to check messages and see replies. This is not reliable and not allowed. 
    - There is a phone app is technically optional, but really really helpful/handy. Students historically have stated it's much easier to work with.
* **How to use Slack**: Useful tutorials on how to navigate in Slack such as finding and start conversations can be found at https://slack.com/resources/slack-101

## Quizzes

Quizzes are a great way to test yourself, enhance recall, and self-assess your comprehension of the subject. Quizzes are administered in Google Forms, and done in two parts.

1. **Individual**: First try to answer as many questions without looking at your notes. Then use your notes to answer the rest. 

2. **Group**: After the individual quiz closes I will choose 1-4 questions that the class as a whole seemed to struggle with the most. The next class period we will do a class-wide discussion of those topics, then you will work in groups to redo the selected questions. 

Points earned from the group quiz get added to your individual quiz score (not to exceed total points).
