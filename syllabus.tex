My name is Robin Donatello and my pronouns are she/her. You can address
me as ``Robin'', ``Dr.~D'', or some other respectful title such as
``professor''.

I have a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) Biostatistics from UCLA, but
I'm a Chico alum. I double majored in Statistics \& Biology, with minor
in Chemistry, and a first generation college student who started at
Butte College.

My campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists
how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and
ethical manner, supporting students in their academic adventures through
intensive advising and research, leading the Data Science Initiative
(DSI) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus, and providing
analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and
off campus.

When I'm not on campus, typically I'm growing ü•ïüåæüçÖüçÜüçè for my family, out
adventuring with my üê∂üßîüê©, or getting some üéÆüé≤üìö time in.

\hypertarget{everyone-is-welcome-here}{%
\subsection{Everyone is welcome here}\label{everyone-is-welcome-here}}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity
of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities
(including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To
help accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from
  those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to
  call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want
  to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as
  accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I
  can do to honor your name.
\item
  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
  your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
  talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
  also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the
  schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a
  general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your
  concerns).
\item
  If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office
  of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
  530-898-4764, and email
  \href{mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}{\nolinkurl{diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}}
\item
  I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse
  perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
  anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
  (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).
\end{itemize}

\emph{Adapted from
\href{https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements}{Monica
Linden at Brown University}}.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on
lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area,
the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with
this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our
campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda
people for centuries.

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\subsection{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

Class attendance is expected regardless if we are in person or online.
Talk to me ahead of time if you need to miss a class for a planned
reason. In the event of an unplanned reason, ping me in Slack when you
can so that I know you are still alive.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you are not feeling well or are showing Covid symptoms
  \textbf{.red\{DO NOT COME TO CLASS\}}. Ping me in Slack and we'll
  figure out a return plan.
\item
  I will be taking daily attendance - this is more for my learning of
  names and to keep an eye out for students who may be struggling in
  class and deciding not to show up.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{zoom-eqituette}{%
\subsection{Zoom Eqituette}\label{zoom-eqituette}}

Sometimes class or student office hours will be held over Zoom. When we
meet online please attend to the following

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Location}: I don't really care where you're at, as long as
  you're not lying down and falling asleep.
\item
  \textbf{Camera}: I want your cameras on. I acknowledge that
  personal/bandwidth limitations do exist and there may be times where
  you need to turn off the camera. I accept those times, but I need to
  see your face as much as possible during our shared experience.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is not a policing tactic, this is to foster connections and
    feel like a community.
  \item
    There are always mitigating circumstances and exceptions. Please
    talk to me if a camera will be a problem.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Microphone}: Keep yourself muted unless sharing out as a way
  to keep background noise to a minimum.
\item
  \textbf{Recording}: As long as I remember to hit record, each
  synchronous online session will be recorded, auto-transcribed and
  posted in Blackboard so it's locked to the class.
\item
  \textbf{Food/drink}: No problem. Just chew with your mouth closed!
\item
  \textbf{Kids/Pets}: Yes please! Pet visits are especially encouraged,
  but we must get introductions.
\item
  \textbf{Filters}: No filters please unless it's pre-arranged (by me).

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{collaboration}{%
\subsection{Collaboration}\label{collaboration}}

Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when
they have someone else to talk through concepts with. Collaboration on
individual quizzes is not allowed.

According to
\href{https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/_assets/documents/collaboration.pdf}{this
document about ollaboration} linked on the CSU, Chico website:

\begin{quote}
Collaboration is working with another or receiving assistance from
someone (e.g., a classmate, friend, or parent, whether in person or by
electronic media) to complete coursework for a grade. ``Unauthorized
collaboration'' means working with others without the specific
permission of the instructor on assignments that will be submitted for a
grade. (i.e.~in class or take home tests, quizzes, labs and homework)
\end{quote}

Below are two quotes from
\href{https://revoteaching.blogspot.com/2021/04/ungrading-and-academic-integrity.html}{this
article} that resonated with me. We will specifically talk about the
idea of why students cheat in the first few weeks as a class.

\begin{quote}
``In my opinion students cheat for one of three reasons (or some
combination): students don't see the value in doing the work, or they
don't believe they can achieve that value if they do the work required
of them, or they don't know how to complete the work. Students cheat
because they see the work as busy work, work that has no value. My
students aren't lazy. They have jobs in addition to school, they have
family obligations, they have financial concerns that sometimes include
housing and food insecurity. They also binge watch entertainment and
play video games for hours on end. They have the ability to pay
attention when their circumstances and their interests allow it.''

``The solution to cheating is to address the motivation to cheat, not
the consequences of cheating. Why would students cheat if they believed
in the value (benefit) of the work, believed the work would produce the
benefit, and believed they could complete the work? Our job as faculty
is convince students of the first two ideas and help them with the
third. And then we trust students to act in their own self-interest.''
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\subsection{Grading}\label{grading}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your grade will be displayed as a running total in Blackboard Learn. I
  will try to enter grades at least every two weeks.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This will not account for dropped quizzes or assignments.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90\%: A, 89-80\%: B, 79-70\%: C,
  69-60\%: D, 0-59\%: F
\item
  Plusses and minuses will be as displayed on Blackboard Learn.
\item
  I reserve the right to round up if borderline (i.e.~89.6\% to a 90\%)
  based on in-class attitude and general engagement in the class. I will
  not round very heavily, don't ask.
\item
  I only give extra credit when something comes up that is relevant to
  the class that I think is really important for you to consider
  attending, but that is outside the existing coursework. Don't ask.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{late-work}{%
\subsection{Late work}\label{late-work}}

Timeliness of assignment submissions are built into the rubric. I will
strive to grade assignments within 1 week of the submission date, of
course prioritizing grading quicker closer to exams. Assignments
submitted after I have finished grading the rest of the class and
re-submissions are graded on a ``when I have time'' basis.

Super late homework will still be accepted after the Gradescope window
has closed and the solutions posted. This work will only be graded for
completeness, and only if your work is not a copy of the solutions.

Quizzes are due at midnight. Will I always be awake laboring over
grading your assignments into the wee hours of the morning and remember
to turn off accepting responses at 12? Probably not, but I'd say it's
likely often enough that I wouldn't chance it if I were you.

\hypertarget{campus-resources}{%

Chico State is requiring everyone on campus to wear an approved face
covering in all indoor campus spaces. Accordingly, all students are
required to wear an appropriate face mask covering the nose and mouth in
order to participate in this course. Policies and requirements regarding
COVID-19 are subject to change pursuant to campus, local, state and/or
federal guidelines.

Please note that dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or
your failure to comply with any other COVID-19 related safety policy or
mandate, including the face covering requirement, may result in
disciplinary action against you through the office of Student Conduct,
Rights and Responsibilities, which can include suspension or expulsion
from the California State University system.

Individuals unable to wear a face covering due to a medical condition
