<h1>Who are we learning it with? (About the instructor)</h1>
<p>My name is Robin Donatello and my pronouns are she/her. You can address me as ‚ÄúRobin‚Äù, ‚ÄúDr.¬†D‚Äù, or some other respectful title such as ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù.</p>
<p>I have a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) Biostatistics from UCLA, but I‚Äôm a Chico alum. I double majored in Statistics &amp; Biology, with minor in Chemistry, and a first generation college student who started at Butte College.</p>
<p>My campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and ethical manner, supporting students in their academic adventures through intensive advising and research, leading the Data Science Initiative (DSI) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus, and providing analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and off campus.</p>
<p>When I‚Äôm not on campus, typically I‚Äôm growing ü•ïüåæüçÖüçÜüçè for my family, out adventuring with my üê∂üßîüê©, or getting some üéÆüé≤üìö time in.</p>

<h1>Class Policies and statements</h1>
<div id="everyone-is-welcome-here" class="section level2">
<h2>Everyone is welcome here</h2>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students‚Äô learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email <a href="mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu" class="email">diversityoffice@csuchico.edu</a></li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adapted from <a href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements">Monica Linden at Brown University</a></em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>Class attendance is expected regardless if we are in person or online. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason, ping me in Slack when you can so that I know you are still alive.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not feeling well or are showing Covid symptoms <strong>.red{DO NOT COME TO CLASS}</strong>. Ping me in Slack and we‚Äôll figure out a return plan.</li>
<li>I will be taking daily attendance - this is more for my learning of names and to keep an eye out for students who may be struggling in class and deciding not to show up.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="zoom-eqituette" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoom Eqituette</h2>
<p>Sometimes class or student office hours will be held over Zoom. When we meet online please attend to the following</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: I don‚Äôt really care where you‚Äôre at, as long as you‚Äôre not lying down and falling asleep.</li>
<li><strong>Camera</strong>: I want your cameras on. I acknowledge that personal/bandwidth limitations do exist and there may be times where you need to turn off the camera. I accept those times, but I need to see your face as much as possible during our shared experience.
<ul>
<li>This is not a policing tactic, this is to foster connections and feel like a community.</li>
<li>There are always mitigating circumstances and exceptions. Please talk to me if a camera will be a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Microphone</strong>: Keep yourself muted unless sharing out as a way to keep background noise to a minimum.</li>
<li><strong>Recording</strong>: As long as I remember to hit record, each synchronous online session will be recorded, auto-transcribed and posted in Blackboard so it‚Äôs locked to the class.</li>
<li><strong>Food/drink</strong>: No problem. Just chew with your mouth closed!</li>
<li><strong>Kids/Pets</strong>: Yes please! Pet visits are especially encouraged, but we must get introductions.</li>
<li><strong>Filters</strong>: No filters please unless it‚Äôs pre-arranged (by me). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGOofzZOyl8">We know you are not a cat.</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="collaboration" class="section level2">
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when they have someone else to talk through concepts with. Collaboration on individual quizzes is not allowed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/_assets/documents/collaboration.pdf">this document about ollaboration</a> linked on the CSU, Chico website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collaboration is working with another or receiving assistance from someone (e.g., a classmate, friend, or parent, whether in person or by electronic media) to complete coursework for a grade. ‚ÄúUnauthorized collaboration‚Äù means working with others without the specific permission of the instructor on assignments that will be submitted for a grade. (i.e.¬†in class or take home tests, quizzes, labs and homework)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below are two quotes from <a href="https://revoteaching.blogspot.com/2021/04/ungrading-and-academic-integrity.html">this article</a> that resonated with me. We will specifically talk about the idea of why students cheat in the first few weeks as a class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn my opinion students cheat for one of three reasons (or some combination): students don‚Äôt see the value in doing the work, or they don‚Äôt believe they can achieve that value if they do the work required of them, or they don‚Äôt know how to complete the work. Students cheat because they see the work as busy work, work that has no value. My students aren‚Äôt lazy. They have jobs in addition to school, they have family obligations, they have financial concerns that sometimes include housing and food insecurity. They also binge watch entertainment and play video games for hours on end. They have the ability to pay attention when their circumstances and their interests allow it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe solution to cheating is to address the motivation to cheat, not the consequences of cheating. Why would students cheat if they believed in the value (benefit) of the work, believed the work would produce the benefit, and believed they could complete the work? Our job as faculty is convince students of the first two ideas and help them with the third. And then we trust students to act in their own self-interest.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your grade will be displayed as a running total in Blackboard Learn. I will try to enter grades at least every two weeks.
<ul>
<li>This will not account for dropped quizzes or assignments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90%: A, 89-80%: B, 79-70%: C, 69-60%: D, 0-59%: F</li>
<li>Plusses and minuses will be as displayed on Blackboard Learn.</li>
<li>I reserve the right to round up if borderline (i.e.¬†89.6% to a 90%) based on in-class attitude and general engagement in the class. I will not round very heavily, don‚Äôt ask.</li>
<li>I only give extra credit when something comes up that is relevant to the class that I think is really important for you to consider attending, but that is outside the existing coursework. Don‚Äôt ask.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="late-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Late work</h2>
<p>Timeliness of assignment submissions are built into the rubric. I will strive to grade assignments within 1 week of the submission date, of course prioritizing grading quicker closer to exams. Assignments submitted after I have finished grading the rest of the class and re-submissions are graded on a ‚Äúwhen I have time‚Äù basis.</p>
<p>Super late homework will still be accepted after the Gradescope window has closed and the solutions posted. This work will only be graded for completeness, and only if your work is not a copy of the solutions.</p>
<p>Quizzes are due at midnight. Will I always be awake laboring over grading your assignments into the wee hours of the morning and remember to turn off accepting responses at 12? Probably not, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs likely often enough that I wouldn‚Äôt chance it if I were you.</p>

Currently, Chico State is requiring everyone on campus to wear an approved face covering in all indoor campus spaces. Accordingly, all students are required to wear an appropriate face mask covering the nose and mouth in order to participate in this course. Policies and requirements regarding COVID-19 are subject to change pursuant to campus, local, state and/or federal guidelines.</p>
<p>Please note that dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or your failure to comply with any other COVID-19 related safety policy or mandate, including the face covering requirement, may result in disciplinary action against you through the office of Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities, which can include suspension or expulsion from the California State University system.</p>
<p>Individuals unable to wear a face covering due to a medical condition should contact the Accessibility Resource Center by phone at (530) 898-5959 or by email at <a href="mailto:arcdept@csuchico.edu" class="email">arcdept@csuchico.edu</a>.</p>

<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity is defined as ‚Äúa commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility‚Äù. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml" class="uri">https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml</a> if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity.</p>
